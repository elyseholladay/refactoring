# Work Plan

#### SassConf Workshop Date: Fri, 10/3, 9am

Current countdown: **SIX DAYS OMG**

## Jina

#### To Do

* introduction is a bit sparse in places; could use more info
* living style guides  (docco, kss, etc, an overview of what they are, vs manual creation - show example of comments in sass file w/ relevant HTML & generate one)
* options for importing and file org -- I mention a simple one, mine at work, and Dale Sande's, but I don't fully grok Dale's and I think we need some better, clearer examples.
* pros and cons of naming conventions (OO, BEM, SMACSS, etc)
* how to iterate on naming conventions and change them
* organizing properties (alpha, properties, camelcase vs underscore vs dash, etc)
* general compromise and getting everyone on the same page, principles of why you are doing a certain way
* variables and abstracting them; options for naming conventions and things you might break out into vars
* testing -- can you talk to Eric about True and how to use it?

## Elyse

#### To Do

* naming conventions - why one would work better than another FOR your project
* modules and refactoring -- create a hands on example for those you dont have project code with them
* doing what is right for your project
* I think we should link to a few options of file/folder rather than showing code in the slides, so I will break that out into folders in this repo
* pros and cons of naming conventions (OO, BEM, SMACSS, etc)
* keeping refactors small so they don't break things
