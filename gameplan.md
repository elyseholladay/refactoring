# Refactoring Gameplan Doc:

### Goal

Every attendee leaves with a game plan of how they would refactor their app. What are my next steps, order of operations,  potential tools to look into.


### Questions

1. My biggest issue/concern w/ my codebase: style issues / importing and file size / specificity and naming problems / ???

2. Current status: CSS / some .scss but not fully transitioned / using it but it's still having naming problems in the HTML / ???

3. First order of business: switch to .scss - determine code kit, rails gem, libsass, etc / break files out into imports and order them OR define color variables/etc even in the same long CSS file
