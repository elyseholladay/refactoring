# Refactoring Gameplan Doc:

## Goal

Every attendee leaves with a game plan of how they would refactor their app. What are my next steps, order of operations,  potential tools to look into.


## Poll

_Before the workshop starts, send out this as a digital poll; we can use survey responses for how much in depth we go, and also general information._

My current Sass status:
[ ] I am not using Sass in my project—but I want to!
[ ] I am using Sass but not utilizing its value.
[ ] I have a good Sass setup but need to refactor/fix up some things.

My biggest issue or concern with my codebase is:
[ ] getting my team to agree on a system/refactoring/using Sass at all
[ ] how to best install/set up Sass in my project
[ ] issues with consistency of visual styles
[ ] specificity and naming problems
[ ] importing, file size, confusing framework/vendor CSS
[ ] responsive code or browser-compliancy
[ ] organization and architecture
[ ] documentation or testing
[ ] I want one of these style guide things everyone is talking about
