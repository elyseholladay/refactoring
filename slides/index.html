						<h2>Clarity &middot; Maintainability &middot; Efficiency &middot; DRY</h2>
						<aside class="notes">
							<p>We generally aim for a few standards in our code: clarity, maintainability, efficiency, and DRYness.</p>
							<p>We want our CSS to be clear, easy to read, easy to maintain; efficient to debug and to write, and to be DRY. Refactoring should improve upon one of those goals, if not all of them at once.</p>
							<p>For example: if your CSS (sass or not!) matches your markup too much, you want to remove or consolidate your nesting or chained classes: refactor. If it may be cleaner and easier to use placeholder extend for a class you aren't using in HTML: refactor. If you have a bunch of classnames that should be a group but aren't: refactor.</p>
						</aside>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h1>Clarity</h1>
						<p>Code should be clear, well-commented, <br/>and follow consistent rules. A developer new <br/>to the project should be able to understand it.</p>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h1>Maintainability</h1>
						<p>Code should be easy to update &#38; maintain, <br/>not requiring hacks or over-specific styles. <br/>It should be clear where files and styles belong.</p>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h1>Efficiency</h1>
						<p>It should be easy for a developer to find <br/>where styles live, write new styles, fix bugs, <br/>or find documentation and instructions.</p>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h1>DRY</h1>
						<p>Don't repeat yourself! Code should <br/>be reusable, have efficient selectors, <br/>and not be overly repetitive or nested.</p>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h6>But what if</h6>
						<ul>
							<li>we didn&rsquo;t write it perfectly the first time</li>
							<li>lack of clarity</li>
							<li>hard to maintain</li>
							<li>new requirements</li>
							<li>design or UI needs to change</li>
							<li>duplication or bloat</li>

						<aside class="notes">
							<p>In many ways, refactoring is like exercise and eating a proper diet. Many of us know that we ought to exercise more and eat a more balanced diet. Some of us live in cultures that highly encourage this. Some of us can get by, for a while, without doing this, perhaps even without visible effects. We can always make excuses for not doing this. But, we are only fooling ourselves if we continue to ignore it. Some of us are motivated by near term benefits of exercise and eating a proper diet, such as high(er) energy levels, greater flexibility, higher self-esteem and other benefits. Nearly all of us know that these near term benefits are very real. Many - but not all - of us make at least sporadic efforts in these areas. Others, however, aren't sufficiently motivated to "do something" until they reach a crisis point.</p>

					</section>

					<section>
						<h1>Systems, not Pages</h1>

						<aside class="notes">
							<p>Jina (YEAH YOU!), in her Sass presentations, says "create systems, not pages." We used to do this—about page, home page, etc etc—but now as our apps and projects have gotten significantly more complex, that's a particularly bad plan.</p>

							<p>How can you make a framework of code that is reusable and modular and separate from individual pages? Instead of "style the homepage", style the modules that are on the homepage.</p>

							<p>Your code should be reusable in as many places as possible, which makes it more efficient to write and debug.</p>

							<p>Sass helps you—or forces you—to do that. When you have the powerful tools of Sass available to you, instead of going to use the color picker to grab a shade of grey from your mockup, you know you can just write $grey. It allows you to write reusable code with very little effort.</p>

						<p class="quote">&#8220;Sass is not a replacement for CSS, it’s more like having a CSS assistant who will help you write your code.&#8221;</p>
                        <h6>— Tom Genoni</h6>
						<aside class="notes">
							<p>Tom Genoni wrote a blog post about switching to Sass, in which he says that the best way to learn Sass without getting the insane output is to not use the crazy functionality in Sass.</p>
							<p>"Sass is not a replacement for CSS, it’s more like having a CSS assistant who will help you write your code. So when you’re ready to really put it to work I recommend occasional sanity checks on the resulting CSS to see if this “assistant” has created too much repeated code or if the selectors are getting too complicated. Refactoring your Sass will help keep your code clean and you’ll start learning how you can make the best use of it."</p>
							<p>I personally think using variables and mixins for obvious things you will reuse (like css3, clearfix, etc) is helpful, but if you are unsure about some of the extend or nesting or functions, don't use them--keep an eye on your code. This is an authoring tool and it's supposed to make your life BETTER, not harder.</p>

						<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
						<h3>I have to use the <br> command line!?</h3>
						<aside class="notes">Yes, to install Sass you MAY have to install it via Rails in the command line. The really long and difficult command you have to write is as follows:</aside>
					</section>

					<section>
						<p><code>gem install sass</code></p>
					</section>

					<section data-state="sass-terminal">
						<p><code class="fragment">sass --watch /path/style.scss:/path/style.css</code></p>
						<aside class="notes">
							<p>When to use terminal: small personal projects that don't require many other tasks done, if you want to learn and get comfortable in Terminal, to quickly compile one file and look at output. Knowing how to use this is a handy skill in your arsenal even if you don't use it as your primary compilation option.</p>
						</aside>
					</section>

					<section data-state="codekit">
						<aside class="notes">
							<p>CodeKit helpfully compiles your stylesheets for you into regular or minified CSS, expanded or collapsed, and has LiveReload. It also now does LiveReload in multiple browsers/devices, creates source maps, and easily allows you to add plugins like Foundation, Compass, via Bower. It also does other types of processing, like Haml or Coffeescript. </p>
							<p>When to use CodeKit: if you prefer a GUI/apps, you want simple compilation AND livereload w/o using a tool like Grunt, you want to use/play with plugins without manual install.</p>
							<p>More: http://css-tricks.com/codekit-2-0/, https://incident57.com/codekit/help.html#sass</p>
						</aside>
					</section>

					<section data-state="foundation-sass">
						<aside class="notes">
							<p>If using Zurb Foundation, you can install and use the Sass version. This allows you to edit the settings and variables, rather than override their complex code. You can also pick and choose which parts of Foundation you want to import.</p>
							<p>You install it with the Foundation command line interface, which uses npm and Bower.</p>
							<p>Then you can choose one of two ways to create a project with Foundation: with Compass as the compiler (which is quite slow), and one with Grunt using the libsass compiler. Obviously the Compass one has Compass included, so you have their styles and mixins available to you automatically, but I prefer the Grunt and libsass version. I find it significantly faster. Neither of these came with livereload, though, or running a server, so you'd have to edit the own grunt file to include it. More on that and libsass later.</p>
							<p>more: http://foundation.zurb.com/docs/sass.html</p>
							<p>If you are prototyping, I <em>love</em> Foundation for this. I think it's valuable to use the Sass version, throw in your variables, colors, type, etc, and super-quickly have a sandbox where you can get a working wireframe up. I know a lot of companies that do this, whether its with Foundation, or like Happy Cog, using Compass and the Susy grid.</p>
						</aside>
					</section>

					<section data-state="libsass">
						<aside class="notes">
							<p>Libsass is a compiler for Sass that does not rely on Ruby to generate the CSS. It’s blazingly fast. You have to compile it (in C), if you are using the original version. You can install and compile it yourself with the C compiler, but there are other ways to access libsass' speed.</p>
						</aside>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h3>10&times; speed improvement</h3>
						<h4>2.5 seconds down to 0.2 seconds</h4>
						<aside class="notes">
							<p>This speed benchmark by Jo Liss http://www.solitr.com/blog/2014/01/css-preprocessor-benchmark/ tested Libsass as providing a massive (>10x) speed improvement over the original Sass compiled in Ruby, dropping processing time from 2.5 seconds to 0.2 seconds.</p>
							<p>She says, "The speed of your CSS preprocessor is important for developer/designer ergonomics. The preprocessing time measured by this benchmark will typically incur as a delay every time you edit the stylesheet sources and hit reload in the browser. Delays below 0.2 to 0.5 seconds tend to be perceived by the human brain as near-instantaneous. The higher the delay, the higher the mental overhead."</p>
							<p>So—we want to be able to use libsass, that's awesome. But I don't feel like trying to deal with a C compiler. Luckily...</p>
						</aside>
					</section>


					<section data-state="node-sass">
						<aside class="notes">
							<p>Node-sass is a library that provides binding for Node.js to libsass.</p>
							<p>This is great if you are using Node, or other JS apps.. or Grunt. Or the Foundation libsass option. They all use the nodesass bind to libsass to compile.</p>

                        <h2 class="fragment wrong">LIES!</h2>
						<aside class="notes">
							<p>And no.. libsass does not yet support Sass 3.3, so it does not support maps. This is probably the biggest complaint we hear about libsass. So if you use the Foundation libsass version, you can't use maps, or plugins like Susy that require Sass 3.3</p>
							<p>On screen is a color-guide that Una Kravets made, and it's using the maps functionality to do so. When I try to copy this into my Foundation-with-libsass project, I get the following error:</p>

							<p>Sooo... Grunt, Gulp, Broccoli, whatever it is nowadays! When I first started getting in to these, I'd ask what they did and people go, "Oh, they're task runners!" Which I think has become one of those non-answers. It's TRUE but I don't think particularly explanatory if you have never used them or don't know what a task being run might even mean.</p>

							<p>Tasks are things like compiling sass, concat/minify js and css, run a local server, live reload, optimize images. Instead of using an app like CodeKit to do that, if we are writing a JS or Rails app, we can write JS to define these tasks, and run them in the Terminal.</p>

							<p>If you are using Grunt or Gulp, and don't need Sass 3.3 features like maps, you can use the grunt-sass plugin—not to be confused with grunt-contrib-sass, the ruby version grunt plugin. grunt-sass compiles with libsass and should be very quick in comparison.</p>

  }
						</code>
						</pre>
						<br />
						<h6>* it's an acronym!</h6>
						<aside class="notes">
							<p>.scss is a much easier place to begin, though, since it's a lot more forgiving and accepts all regular CSS.</p>
							<p>If you are switching from .css, or have a lot of devs/people on your project that are not as familiar with CSS, this is probably a good option. It can also be more convenient if you are pulling in lots of vendor or framework code.</p>
						</aside>
					</section>

					<section>
						<p><code>.sass</code> syntax uses indentation rather than brackets to indicate nesting of selectors, and newlines rather than semicolons to separate properties.</p>
						<pre>
						<code class="sass">
  .widget /* look ma, no brackets! */
    color: #fff /* or semi-colons! */
    background: $backgroundColor
    margin: 20px
    padding: 20px

  // you can use shorthand includes
  =large-text // instead of @mixin large-text
    font-size: 20px
    color: #ff0000

  h1
    +large-text // instead of @include large-text
						</code>
						</pre>

						<aside class="notes">
							<p>I personally like the .sass syntax; I find it forces me to be more cautious about nesting, and I love not typing brackets or semicolons.</p>
							<p>It's a good choice for those familiar with things like HAML, or who like significant whitespace, or like me, are lazy. It's also less to type if you use the oldschool syntax. Instead of writing @mixin, you can use the character =; instead of writing @include, you can use the character +</p>

  }
    .nav-item {generic: styles;} // indented under .nav but NOT nested

  // .sass syntax uses indentation as nesting
  .nav
    styles: go here
    .nav-item // now will output as .nav .nav-item
      generic: styles // now are possibly not generic anymore
						</code>
						</pre>
						<aside class="notes">
							<p>It can be difficult to switch from .scss to .sass if you use indentation in .scss to denote relationships. If you do that in .sass, it will be nested. You have to take the time when switching to make sure your code isn't all crazy nested (and therefore potentially broken).</p>
							<p>in the above example, let's imagine that the .nav-item styles apply to .nav and also to .footer-nav; in the .sass syntax case that would no longer be true, and your styles would be broken.</p>

Keep it as simple as you can. A big part of refactoring is choosing small battles; if you try to do it all at once you will always give up.</p>

							<p>This is something you just have to do manually and slowly. Presumably, in your CSS, you'll have sections. If you have a section, you can copy it wholesale into a new file and import it. If you import them in the same order as they were in the CSS file, you shouldn't have any errors. Obviously this is not foolproof!</p>

							<p>Now is a really good time to take a little inventory of the UI of your app. What _should_ be white but is actually a super light grey? Do you have two VERY similar colors of blue? Can you consolidate some of your colors as you go to make things more efficient?</p>

						<p>Import <code>variables.scss</code> into your manifest first.</p>
						<aside class="notes">
							<p>Now you can import this file into your manifest; of course it has to go first. Now is a good time to do a visual runthrough and make sure you aren't seeing anything that doesn't work. Maybe your #f9f9f9 really did need to be that, and not white. Just check. This is harder on a larger project, but whether you're checking visually or in your codebase (e.g. did you make an element w/ the bg and color both $white) you should take the time. If you already have something like visual diff testing set up, that'd be another great way to test.</p>

						<aside class="notes">
							<p>Use Sass' built in color operations to make a light grey that is just a lighter version of our dark grey, rather than defining a new hex value. I'm also using transparentize to make an rgba color for transparent text, rather than defining another rgba color.</p>

							<p>Sass has a ton of these: lighten, darken, saturate, desaturate, invert, complement, adjust hue, alpha (returns alpha value), opacify/transparentize (not kidding, real names- makes more or less opaque), even "change-color" to change any property of a color: red, green, blue values, hue, saturation, lightness, and alpha.</p>

							<p>So here I am pointing our body font to $fontBody, and our headlines to $fontHeadline. Note that it's possible to point the $fontBody variable or vice versa in your variable declarations, if you only wanted one font. I'd still define 2 variables, and use them appropriately: for an h2, I'd use $fontHeadline; if it was in the body or a paragraph declaration, I'd use $fontBody. Even though $fontBody points to $fontHeadline, let's imagine change it later. If you used $fontHeadline in the body declaration, and changed the $fontBody variable, your body font wouldn't change.</p>
						</aside>
					</section>

					<section data-state="fontsizes">
						<aside class="notes">
							<p>Harry Roberts of CSS Wizardry wrote an article called "Pragmatic, practical font sizing in CSS" and in it he came up with this greek lettering method of naming font sizes. Instead of ONLY defining your font sizes on h1, h2, h3, etc, we also define it on classes alpha, beta, etc. "So now .alpha can carry the style information of a h1 wherever you wish; it doesn’t depend on location or a type of element."</p>
							<p>I took that one step further with Sass, and used the new placeholder extend functionality. Now I don't have to have classnames in my HTML, but I can extend them in my Sass, like this:</p>
						</aside>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h5><code>font-size</code> extends</h5>
					<pre>
						<code class="sass">
  .notification {
    &:hover { background: lighten($tertiary_color,25%); }
    &.read { background: transparentize($tertiary_color,75%); }

    .icon-arrow-right {
      @extend %milli;
      color: $greylight;
    }

    .icon-notification {
      @extend %delta;
      color: $primary_color_bright;
      padding: 5px 10px 0 0;
      float: left;
    }
}
						</code>
					</pre>
						<aside class="notes">
							<p>Just @extend %delta, and you'll get 18px, without having to put the classname in your HTML. Additionally, from the content in the typography.sass file, h4 is output, but %delta itself isn't. You could take that one step further and eliminate the h1-6 selectors and ONLY use the placeholders, if you wanted. This works really well for me at work, because in our complex app, we prefer to use unique classnames over HTML selectors, to eliminate cascade issues. For clarity, I also like to not have non-informational classnames in my HTML, like, .delta. If you are working on your own blog or something smaller, it probably isn't as necessary to either eliminate this much CSS output, or avoid the classnames, but whether or not you use placeholder or classes, this is still a very valuable organization technique.</p>
							<p>You should be able to do this without really changing much of your output CSS. If you go through the places in your codebase that you have font-size declarations, the same as we did for color variables, and replace with @extend .delta (whether that's a class or placeholder), you'll get the exact same output. If you are adding line-height to your typography.scss file you might have to be a bit more careful. Now you also have consistency going forward. </p>

							<p>A better way to name these variables would be to start with the generic word they all share in common: blue. Then we can get more specific from left to right:</p>
							<p>This not only helps in recollection, but will allow a text editor (such as Sublime Text, Coda etc.) to easily suggest colors. This way you don't have to memorize exactly how you named your variables. Rather, you can start generically and get more specific as the text editor auto-suggests variable names. All you have to remember is you want a color of blue. So you begin typing $blue and you can get a list of all the different blues you've created!</p>

							<p>Dale Sande gave a great talk called Clean out your Sass junk drawer, and he goes way in depth on some ways to do this.</p>
							<p>"While part of a team developing an enterprise CMS, our process was to decompose a site's UI to it's lowest common elements. From those elements we could then build modules and then finally assemble the view templates. Each step building on the previous. Although my stylesheet management techniques weren't perfect, my concept of UI abstraction was solid.

							Working with a new team, sans a CMS, I went into the project with the same conceptual understanding, but the outcome was drastically different. The code became increasingly harder to reuse and making simple edits resulted in the reengineering of HTML as well as CSS. Post launch, I sat down and analyzed the code I wrote. I came to the realization that we were engineering our UI (CSS and HTML) from entirely the wrong perspective. We were approaching our development from the full page perspective. Engineering all our visual elements from the outside-in and scoped to a specific view.

							I started thinking back to the processes I pioneered with the CMS. Patterns established in the framework dictated we start from the elemental perspective; type, colors, forms, basic UI chrome (borders, shadows, icons, etc) all coded first. Once those element styles were completed, it was a matter of applying the skin to the CMS modules. The modules then in-turn were used to assemble the view. It worked quickly and seamlessly. Building the UIs from the inside-out was clearly the solution."</p>

							<p>His mantra is "code the element, create the module and assemble the layout."</p>
							<p>Elemental partials is where we get to work. Here we write Sass rules that will create your UI foundational layer. _buttons.scss, _forms.scss, _global_design.scss, _reset.scss and _typography.scss all contain Sass rules that will process into CSS. While they will import other partials, mixins and silent placeholder rules, it is important to remember that these files are engineered only to output CSS.

							Taking buttons as an example; between gradients, :hover and :active states, one could go a little mad over the complexities in styling. It is important to keep your Sass logic out of these files and focus purely on the rules that will produce CSS for your selector.

							Keeping functional Sass separate from presentational Sass is important in order to maintain readability, search-ability and scaleability of your code. Patterns like placing mixins in the same file as presentational Sass leads to overly complex files to scan and opportunities for accidental pollution of your processed CSS.</p>

							<p>No but srsly. At Bazaarvoice we had 3 separate codebases, one for Reviews, one for AA, one for Stories. We wanted to consolidate the CSS, but it was too big of an undertaking to refactor all the HTML and UI components.</p>
							<p>So what we did is we printed out every page/area of our software. Then we took them in groups and with colored pencils, boxed out what sections were the same.</p>
							<p>All primary buttons got one color, secondary another. Common form elements got one; headers another. After that we boxed out larger page modules, like "comment" and "comment form" and larger than that, "comment area".</p>
							<p>This helped us determine what our modules were. Even though we couldn't change our HTML, when we were writing our Sass (ok, LESS) templates, we could group all the relevant CSS classnames together in one declaration, rather than having multiple redundant files.</p>

At the very least you’ve used the trick from HTML5 Boilerplate to target versions of IE with some well-placed conditional comments? What do all of these have in common? They all dynamically, in one form or another, add classes to the root html class. In Modernizr’s case it tells you what features you can hook into within your CSS. In Google’s web-font loader it will update some classes in to tell us if and when our typefaces are loading or have loaded. This is where that ampersand has made things easier for me."</p>

						<aside class="notes">
							<p>[read before slide] Sometimes you’ll write styles for a class that you only ever want to @extend, and never want to use directly in your HTML. For our box styles, if that's visual only and the class .box never appears in our HTML, why output it into our CSS if it will never get applied? If you use normal classes and use @extend for this, you end up creating a lot of extra CSS when the stylesheets are generated. [now read slide]</p>

							<p>So here you can see it's just removed class .box from the output. Not a major decrease here but if you do this a lot, then you will see much less clutter in your CSS. This is especially helpful for visual helpers, like typography classes; I use it for named sizes and a "meta" style, which is ~20-40 lines of code in my CSS that I can eliminate with placeholders. Again, not a HUGE amount of file size.. but less junk. And when you are writing a BIG project, it adds up.</p>

Sometimes import order can cause specificity problems, so it's worth taking some time to look at all the places you know this module exists on your site/app to see if it's still working.

                        <aside class="notes">
                            <p>First, extract a base class. Determine what a shared classname might be and copy over all the repeated styles that you might want all buttons to share.</p>
                            <p>For now we're going to add that base class to some/all of the places this module exists in our HTML. This is a test step, to make sure everything applies OK. We'll clean this up even more going forward.</p>
                            <p>If that's looking good, let's change our base class from a class to a placeholder extend.</p>
                            <p>If you have individual classes (for example, generic button base class versus unique button classes), apply the `@extend %[MODULE]` on all of them. Compile and check it out—should be exactly the same.</p>
                            <p>You can now add unique styles to each module that requires it—colors, backgrounds, icons text colors, etc, to each class so that they look the same as they did before. </p>

                        <aside class="notes">
                            <p>Figure out what you can nest inside the parent `%MODULE`—or under each individual button class. For clickable elements, `:hover` and `:active` states should be pretty obvious.</p>
                            <p>For some modules, you may need to <em>remove</em> nesting—if you're editing Sass, perhaps things are nested in so far you want to refactor that <strong>out</strong>.</p>
                            <p>Use the &#38; parent selector to nest, and don't forget you can do it three ways, depending on a) what output you want and b) what makes for the most understandable code</p>

                        <h1>5. Edit HTML Classes</h1>
                        <aside class="notes">
                            <p>We have made a lot of good progress toward reusability and modularity, so even if the classes of the actual individual modules are all inconsistent, we have done a lot. But some good search-and-replace can get us to a modular setup that will help in the future, when we want to add even more of the same module.</p>
                            <p>Determine what naming convention works best for this module. Write out the naming convention and then create classes for it. Now edit the HTML of the buttons to use the new classes; make sure you make any other HTML edits that might be necessary while you're at it! Add the new classes into your CSS and you should have some much prettier code now.</p>

                        <aside class="notes">
                            <p>Now that we know our refactored classnames, how our `%extend` is working, and the unique styles are applied, let's do a pass to see what those unique styles—colors, backgrounds, icons, fonts, etc—actually are.</p>
                            <p>Your module may just use existing variables from `variables.scss` or your grid or what not.
                            <p>It might also be worthwhile to create variables strictly for your module.</p>
                            <p>Now is a good time to fix up things like inconsistent background colors or hover colors, highlighting, borders, etc. Visual errors are much easier to fix up now, when you can automate how they change.</p>

                        <aside class="notes">
                            <p>In this—optional—step we're going to take all the redundant code in our unique classes and make a mixin to do the hard work for us. Some modules really benefit from this; in others, there's really no point. You have to determine for yourself if it's valuable to you.</p>

                            <p>If you're rewriting CSS properties for multiple unique versions of a module—such as color, background-color, borders or box-shadows, hover states, etc—you might want to make a mixin, so you can change all those styles in _one line_?</p>
