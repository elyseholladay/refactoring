## MakerSquare Architecture Example

This is how I am architecting things at MakerSquare for our new website. It's fairly simple, as this is a marketing site, rather than a large product.

Please note this is _very much_ still a work in progress, so there will probably be wonky code in places and the architecture may change going forward!
