# Overview

start w/ Q&A
what are you in your project

## Part One: CSS -> Sass

* overview of ways to install/use it (codekit, rails gem, libsass)
* ways to switch easily (.css -> .scss, pulling out variables like colors, type, etc, importing files w/o changing import order)
* commenting (per file, per section, instructions)
* small chunks - one thing at a time!
* where do all your modules live? determine WHAT modules you have, WHERE they are, which should be the same, which need a parent to have a style change under (namespacing)


## Part Two: Adv Sass Refactoring

* living style guides  (docco, kss, etc, an overview of what they are, vs manual creation - show example of comments in sass file w/ relevant HTML & generate one)
* html/css class naming refactoring (elements -> classnames, naming conventions (whatever you do, be consistent) .section, .section-item, .section-item-individualthingy ) - good place for examples/live coding
* how to test for changes/things that are broken after a refactor
